Bootcards: A cards-based UI framework for mobile and desktop apps, built on top of Bootstrap
=========

Bootcards is a cards-based UI framework. It is built on top of Bootstrap and uses it's responsive features. Bootcards has a native look on Android, iOS and desktop.

**Why Bootcards?**

We think Cards are the design pattern for mobile of the future. The near future that is. Cards are appearing already on sites and apps like Twitter, Google Now, Facebook, Spotify, Pinterest, and Amazon. To kickstart your (and our) projects we decided to create Bootcards.

**Work in progress**

Bootcards is work in progress. You'll find a first public release in this repository. We also built a simple demo app showcasing what the framework (and your apps) can look like using NodeJS. You'll find it <a href="http://bootcards.herokuapp.com"  target="_blank">here</a> (note that adding, saving and deleting items is not implemented). Please let us know what you think!
